# Fare Share

Fare Share is an app built for friends living in different cities who want to travel together. It allows each user to create trips for a group of users. All users of that trip can then one-click-search flights for everyone in the group. The app uses the Google Flights API to find the cheapest dates/destinations for everyone on the trip. All search results in a trip are then viewable by all users of that trip, and all users can then vote for their preferred option for that trip. With easy-to-view Google Maps of flight paths and Chart.js summaries of the flight prices, Fare Share makes it easier for friends living all over to plan travel together.
